For mac user, run: yarn install
for window user, run: "npm install" command to install all dependencies of the project

# add a new Powershell terminal and cd into "api" folder to install all it's dependencies
#For mac user, run: yarn install
#for window user, run: "npm install" command to install all dependencies of the project

# now, you are ready to go
# for window user
#you can either run: "npm start" to save yourself troubles of reruning "node server.js" everytime u need to start the server.
#or u can run: "node server.js" which is time consuming
#in the terminal where u cd into client, run: "yarn start" autonatically the server will open on the port connected on it



# Note: for the mac user, run: "yarn start" instead of npm to install or start the server
